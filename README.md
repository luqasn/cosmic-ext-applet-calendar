A standalone calendar and agenda applet for the Pop!_OS COSMIC Desktop. Fetches events from Evolution Data Server (Google Calendar, Nextcloud, CalDAV) and local `.ics` files, displaying event dots on the monthly calendar grid and an agenda list for selected days.

Built as an independent applet using `libcosmic`, decoupled from the core `cosmic-applets` monorepo.

## Features

- **Google Calendar, Nextcloud & CalDAV Sync:** Queries Evolution Data Server (EDS) over D-Bus with zero configuration if your account is signed in via GNOME Online Accounts or Evolution.
- **Local `.ics` File Support:** Auto-discovers calendar and public holiday `.ics` files in `~/.local/share/calendars/`, `~/.local/share/cosmic-calendar/`, and `/usr/share/calendar/`.
- **Calendar Event Dots:** Monthly grid shows indicator dots beneath days with scheduled events.
- **Chronological Agenda:** Selecting a day lists its events sorted by time (all-day events at top) with title, time, and location.
- **One-Click Meeting Join:** Shows a **Join Meeting** button for Google Meet links (from Google's conference field, the location, or the description) and opens them in your default browser. Other services can be added to the whitelist in `src/event/meeting.rs`.
- **Battery & Performance Optimization:** Zero background polling or CPU wakeups when the popup is closed. In-memory LRU cache with a 60-second TTL provides instant 0ms month navigation.
- **Fault-Tolerant Deduplication:** Deduplicates events appearing across multiple calendars or identical recurring instances without dropping distinct meetings at the same hour.
- **40+ Language Translations:** Built-in localization support via Fluent.

## Installation

### Method 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

Downloads the prebuilt binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin/`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hasmolam/cosmic-ext-applet-calendar/main/install.sh | bash
```

To also replace your top bar's digital clock:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hasmolam/cosmic-ext-applet-calendar/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --replace-clock
```

### Method 2: Build with Just (Standard System Install)

Requires `cargo` and `just`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hasmolam/cosmic-ext-applet-calendar.git
cd cosmic-ext-applet-calendar
just build
sudo just install
```

### Method 3: Build from Source with Cargo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hasmolam/cosmic-ext-applet-calendar.git
cd cosmic-ext-applet-calendar
cargo build --release
./install.sh
```

## Usage Modes

This applet natively supports two distinct operational modes:

1. **Standalone Panel Applet (Default):**
   Displays a calendar icon with today's day of the month in your panel or dock.
   Go to **Settings → Desktop → Panel → Applets**, search for **Calendar & Agenda**, and add it anywhere.
2. **Drop-in Clock Replacement:**
   Replaces the default COSMIC digital clock (`cosmic-applet-time`) on your top bar, retaining standard time formatting while opening the calendar and agenda on click. Enabled via `./install.sh --replace-clock`.

## Configuring Calendars

The applet reads from Evolution Data Server (EDS) over D-Bus and from local `.ics` files. It does not communicate directly with proprietary cloud APIs, meaning any service supported by EDS works out of the box.

### 1. Cloud Calendars (Google, Nextcloud, CalDAV)

COSMIC Settings (`cosmic-settings`) does not currently include a native Online Accounts configuration panel. On Pop!_OS and Ubuntu-based COSMIC systems, configure your accounts through GNOME Online Accounts.

Because GNOME Control Center restricts execution outside GNOME/Unity sessions, launch the Online Accounts panel with the `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` override:

```bash
env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center online-accounts
```

1. Select **Google**, **Nextcloud**, or **WebDAV (CalDAV)**.
2. Sign in and verify that the **Calendar** toggle is enabled.
3. Evolution Data Server will synchronize events in the background. The applet discovers new calendars on its next popover open.

On non-GNOME distributions (e.g. Arch Linux, Fedora Minimal), you can configure accounts using the Evolution mail client GUI (`evolution` -> Edit -> Preferences -> Calendars) or any EDS-compatible setup tool.

### 2. Local `.ics` Files (Offline)

If you do not want cloud synchronization, copy any standard iCalendar (`.ics`) file into:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/calendars
cp your-calendar.ics ~/.local/share/calendars/
```

The applet also scans `~/.local/share/cosmic-calendar/` and `/usr/share/calendar/` for system holidays.

## Next Meeting in the Panel (Clock Replacement)

In clock replacement mode, the applet can show the next meeting after the time, e.g. `Oct 6 10:35 AM · in 25m Standup`. While a meeting is in progress it reads `now Standup` until the meeting ends. When there are no more meetings today, it shows tomorrow's first meeting, e.g. `tomorrow 9:00 AM Standup`. All-day events and meetings after tomorrow are not shown.

This is opt-in. Enable it with the **Show next meeting in panel** toggle at the bottom of the calendar popover, or from a shell:

```bash
echo true > ~/.config/cosmic/com.system76.CosmicAppletTime/v1/show_next_meeting
```

Turning it on also shows a **Bold countdown in the last 15 minutes** toggle (off by default). It makes the `in 12m` part bold once the meeting is 15 minutes or less away. To turn it on from a shell:

```bash
echo true > ~/.config/cosmic/com.system76.CosmicAppletTime/v1/bold_imminent_meeting
```

When enabled, the applet refreshes today's and tomorrow's events every 5 minutes, even while the popover is closed. It is only shown on horizontal (top/bottom) panels.

---

## Uninstallation

To completely remove the applet and restore the default system clock:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hasmolam/cosmic-ext-applet-calendar/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/cosmic-ext-applet-calendar ~/.local/bin/cosmic-applet-time
rm -f ~/.local/share/applications/io.github.hasmolam.cosmic-ext-applet-calendar.desktop
rm -f ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/io.github.hasmolam.cosmic-ext-applet-calendar-symbolic.svg
killall cosmic-panel
```

## Architecture

```
libcosmic Window Loop
       │
       ▼
  EventCache (LRU, 60s TTL)
       │
       ▼
CompositeBackend
  ├── LocalIcsBackend (~/.local/share/calendars/*.ics)
  └── EdsBackend (org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Calendar over zbus 5 D-Bus)
```

The applet implements a modular `CalendarBackend` trait. When official COSMIC Accounts support is released in upstream COSMIC, adding support requires only implementing the trait.
